# Context and Dependency Injection(CDI) Framework
- CDI standardizes dependency Injection for java EE
- Defines diffrent annotations for dependency injection like @Named @Inject @Scope @Singleton 
- diffrent CDI implementations framework provide support and functionality for this annotations.
- @Named is used to define a bean and @Inject is used for autowiring one bean into another
- Spring supports most of this functionalities  defined by CDI.
- @Named is equivalent to @Component in CDi
- @Inject is equivalent to @Autowired in CDI
- other annotations include @Singleton, @Qualifier, @scope
- above annotations are similar to the ones we've seen in Spring.
