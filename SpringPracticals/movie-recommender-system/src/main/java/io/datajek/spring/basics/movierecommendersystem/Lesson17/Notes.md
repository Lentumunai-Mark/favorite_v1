# CONNECTING TO JDBC LIBRARY
- Spring JDBC makes talking to databases easy by eliminating the need for
establishing a connection, handling expectations, and closing connections.
- Spring provides a template class called JdbcTemplate to interact with
databases which offers a wide array of methods to perform storage and
retrieval of data.
- The JdbcTemplate class hides all the boilerplate code for
connection management and error handling whereby the developer can
focus on the SQL query.
- Using the Spring JdbcTemplate , a Java application can store and retrieve
objects of a class to a table in the database.
